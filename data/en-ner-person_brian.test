SEATTLE – Natalie Gostynski and her boyfriend, Kyle Holmes, spend most days asking strangers for money. Then, in a park surrounded by million-dollar homes, the couple returns to a canvas tent for sleep each night, keeping an eye out for places such as gas stations and restaurants where they can wash up along the way.

The couple's situation here, in one of the fastest-growing U.S. cities, is not unique. As Seattle's economy has soared with an influx of newcomers and global business, so, too, has the number of people unable to keep up with the subsequent growing costs of housing, stressing social and health services to the extreme.From as far south as San Diego to Bellingham, Washington, in the north of the Pacific Coast, cities are facing the same issue with rising levels of homelessness, causing a mix of government and private agencies to mobilize into action. Crucial among the response: public health officials.

"The issues around homelessness are a challenge to the health system," says Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. "Not having a regular place to live often translates to not having a good source of care."

In California, a hepatitis A outbreak has affected Los Angeles, Santa Cruz and San Diego – a popular tourist destination in a county where more than 5,600 people live outside or in vehicles, The Associated Press reports.

Encampments with trash, rats, needles and human waste pose health risks in cities ranging in size from Seattle to Oregon City, while officials consider if or to what extent they should intervene to clean up the sites. In Seattle, housing activists have pushed back against government-led "sweeps."

Living without permanent housing often means going without proper hygiene, routine health screenings, vaccinations to fight disease and treatment for mental illnesses or substance abuse issues that can exacerbate the reasons someone became homeless in the first place. Also, people without homes cannot properly heal after hospitalization, says Dr. Jeff Duchin, the Seattle and King County health officer for public health.

"This is a huge challenge for us right now," Duchin says. "They don't have anywhere to go, and the hospital is reluctant to put them back on the street."In Seattle's downtown core, building cranes and homeless encampments illustrate the city's income disparity. Construction machinery for new office and apartment complexes fills the skyline, while communities of tents under highway underpasses or in parks grow, along with the number of people living in vehicles along streets.

Gostynski, 30, and Holmes, 28, are on their fourth tent since setting up camp together roughly eight months ago in a park in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood, where the median price of a house recently hit a record-breaking $1 million. People have slashed or vandalized the couple's previous tents, Gostynski says. Others have spit. And dogs have used the setup to urinate.In terms of keeping clean and going to the bathroom, Gostynski says they improvise. She caught the stomach flu twice but did not take time to rest, she says, because of the "necessary things" to do – namely, trying to get money for food and water.

Gostynski and Holmes, both of whom say they have been sober from drugs and alcohol for years, have so far not sought temporary shelter at a nonprofit- or city-run space because they fear getting split up. Holmes has epilepsy; Gostynski has mental disabilities. They say they need each other to sleep each night.

Often, shelters split groups of beds by gender.

But even securing a spot at an emergency shelter would potentially come only after a lengthy, and sometimes challenging, process for getting one. In Seattle, some people occupy beds for months or even years, resulting in a bottleneck for space that leaves thousands on the streets, according to The Seattle Times.Seattle is among numerous city and county governments in Washington, Oregon and California to have declared states of emergency over homelessness, meaning officials have pledged additional money or help toward related social and health services. In those three states, the number of people living in tents, vehicles and other places federal authorities deem uninhabitable has climbed 23 percent over the past two years, according to the AP.

The region's fast, exploding wealth fueled the spike. On a broad scale, officials have not built affordable housing at the rates communities need, says Jeff Sheehy, a member of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors. That failure is linked to their ability to combat pervasive public health issues around homelessness.

"As a society, there's a great deal of failure," Sheehy says. "We're trying to solve all of these failures on the back end."

Gostynski and Holmes say they are unable to afford housing because their medical and mental disabilities make it hard to hold jobs, and their daily goal right now is to survive.

Most people do not realize they, too, are just steps away from being homeless, Holmes says.

"It is one of the populations most at risk for a range of preventable diseases," Benjamin says. "At the end of the day, the solution for a lot of this stuff is getting them home."
